# Travel Planner (static frontend)

This repository contains a static frontend application recreated from the Jupyter Notebook `Untitled2.ipynb`. The app is a simple, accessible travel planner UI (HTML/CSS/JS) intended for static hosting (e.g., Vercel).

How to use:

- Open `index.html` locally in a browser, or deploy the repository to Vercel/GitHub Pages.
- The app is static and uses JavaScript for basic interactivity (menu toggle, form stubs, alerts).

Files added:
- `index.html` — main HTML page
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — basic interactivity
- `assets/.gitkeep` — placeholder for images/fonts
